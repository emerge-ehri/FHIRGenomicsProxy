# FHIR Genomics Proxy
Deployed a secure FHIR Genomics Proxy instance and configured an authorization access role for Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) users to send FHIR bundles from BCM into the Johns Hopkins cloud-based ancillary genomics system.

## Overview
At Johns Hopkins University (JHU), we implemented the [Azure API for FHIR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir/) (MS FHIR API), a cloud-based FHIR service for FHIR version R4.  We then modified and deployed a secure FHIR Proxy service ([FHIRProxy](https://github.com/microsoft/health-architectures/tree/master/FHIR/FHIRProxy)).
 
In summary, the FHIRProxy ties in Azure Active Directory and Key Vault, allowing for direct authentication/authorization tie-ins to institutions with Microsoft login implementations.  In addition, it allows for the creation of service accounts, making automated data upload and analysis seamless.
 
For the FHIR Genomics Proxy,  we created a service account for the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) FHIRClient.  With proper authentication parameters, BCM Data can obtain an authorization token, to submit data.  With the token, BCM Data uploads lab reports (i.e., FHIR transaction bundles) to the FHIR Genomics Proxy.  The FHIR Genomics Proxy processes the bundles and stores them in the MS FHIR API.

## Modifications to FHIRProxy and FHIRClient
Currently, the MS FHIR API accepts batch, rather than transaction, bundles. Batch bundles require additional information in order to maintain associations between the bundled data.  This required changes to be made to both the FHIRProxy and FHIRClient to include association information into the submissions to the MS FHIR API. Once we made these changes, we were able to retrieve associated bundles from the MS FHIR API.
